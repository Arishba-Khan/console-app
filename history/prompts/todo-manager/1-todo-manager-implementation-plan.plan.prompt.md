  /sp.plan You are an expert in Spec-Driven Development (SDD) using the Spec-Kit Plus methodology. Your task is to write a complete, professional sp.plan.md file for the project.

  Strictly follow these guidelines:
  - Output ONLY the Markdown content of sp.plan.md — no introductions, no extra comments, no code.
  - Use clear Markdown structure: headings, subheadings, numbered/bulleted lists, tables when useful.
  - The plan must be realistic, incremental, and logically sequenced for reliable AI-assisted implementation.
  - Reference and NEVER contradict the existing sp.constitution and sp.specification (pasted below).
  - Focus on HOW to build the system — not re-specifying WHAT (that's the specification's job).
  - Cover architecture decisions, module breakdown, data flow, key implementation strategies, dependency order, testing approach, and major milestones.
  - Plan for ALL levels: Basic → Intermediate → Advanced, but emphasize completing Basic first, then layering on the rest.
  - Include rough sequencing of major implementation steps / logical task groups (these will later become detailed tasks).

  Required sections for sp.plan.md (include all of them):
  1. Title & Metadata (project name, plan version, date, status)
  2. Overall Development Strategy & Milestones
  3. High-Level Architecture & Module Breakdown
  4. Key Technical Decisions & Conventions
  5. Incremental Implementation Roadmap (phased by feature level)
     - Phase 1: Basic Level features
     - Phase 2: Intermediate Level features
     - Phase 3: Advanced Level features
     For each phase: list major components to build or extend, in recommended order
  6. Testing Strategy
  7. Risks, Trade-offs & Mitigations
  8. Next Steps after this plan (e.g. break into detailed tasks)

  Project context summary (do NOT copy-paste this — synthesize):
  - CLI todo app, in-memory only (list of Task objects)
  - Python 3.13+, uv, clean code, type hints, dataclasses
  - REPL-style interface
  - Features: Basic (add/view/update/delete/mark), Intermediate (priority/tags/search/filter/sort), Advanced (due date/recurring/overdue)
  - No persistence in Phase 1
  - All code generated by Qwen agent

  Existing artifacts (follow exactly — do NOT contradict):
  Now write the complete sp.plan.md file content in valid Markdown.
response_text: |
  Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Todo Console – In-Memory Task Manager, including:
  - Detailed architecture breakdown with layered approach
  - Phased implementation roadmap (Basic → Intermediate → Advanced)
  - Technology stack and coding conventions
  - Testing strategy with unit and integration tests
  - Risk mitigation approaches
  - Next steps for implementation
outcome: "Plan successfully created with all required sections and adherence to constitution/spec requirements"
evaluation: "Complete implementation plan with proper architecture decisions and phased approach"
